# Modern Programming Languages Lecture Projects 

## biggest.py
This program asks the user to enter two integers and compares them. It checks which number is greater or if both numbers are equal. The comparison logic is implemented in a separate function, while user input and error handling are managed in the main function. If the user enters a non-integer value, the program displays an error message and terminates safely.

## count_words.py
This program reads a text file to count the number of words it contains and allows replacing a specific word with another one. It updates the file with the modified content and reports how many replacements were made.

## dices.py
This program simulates rolling two six-sided dice 1,000 times. For each roll, it calculates the sum of the two dice and counts how often each possible outcome occurs. Finally, it prints the frequency of each dice sum.

## evenfibonacci.py
This program calculates the sum of even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed four million. It generates Fibonacci numbers iteratively starting from 1 and 2, checks each term for evenness, and adds the even terms to a running total. The final result is printed to the screen.

## graphDrawing13thNov.py
This program uses NumPy and Matplotlib to plot trigonometric functions. It generates a range of x values and computes the sine and cosine of each value. Both functions are plotted on the same graph with labeled axes, a title, a legend, and grid lines, and the graph is displayed to the user.

## lesson1.py
This program defines two functions to find the largest and smallest values among three numbers. It generates three random integers between 1 and 1000, determines the smallest of them using a custom function, and prints the result.

## listWithRandom.py
This program generates a list of random integers. It creates an empty list and fills it with four random numbers between 1 and 11, then prints the resulting list.

## main.py
This program demonstrates basic list operations. It first shows (in comments) how to append values to a list and calculate the average of its elements. Then, it generates a list of four random integers between 1 and 50 and prints the list.

## main2.py
This program works with lists by showing how to print them in normal and reversed order. It includes a function that creates a reversed copy of a list and prints both the original and reversed versions. Another function checks if a list is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version and prints True or False based on the result.

## multiplesof3or5.py
This program calculates the sum of all natural numbers below a given limit that are multiples of 3 or 5. It iterates through each number, checks if it is divisible by 3 or 5, adds it to a running total if it is, and finally prints the total sum.

## pythonKoordinatHesaplama.py
This program estimates the value of pi using a Monte Carlo simulation. It generates random points (x, y) in the unit square and counts how many fall below the quarter circle defined by the condition that the y-value must be less than or equal to the square root of one minus x squared. By multiplying the ratio of points inside the quarter circle by four, it approximates pi and prints the result.
